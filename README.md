# ENTREZO Promotions

Scaffolding built on Laravel 5.6 that can be used for quickly getting an online photo submission competition up and running.

DB seeder is included (generates images too). Also includes Google reCAPTACHA integration.

*Note - This project is still under development internally and the code is some way from being in even a 'beta' ready state. Very minimal front-end work has been done. Keep coming back for more releases and we will add deployment instructions when we feel an MVP has been built.*
